<h1>What Film?</h1>
<h3>Third Milestone Project: Data Centric Development - Code Institute</h3>
<h4>By Lewis Hamilton</h4>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://lewejuice.github.io/starwars-quiz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Star Wars quiz</a> is an interactive trivia game with a Star Wars theme.</p>
<br>
<p>I have built this game to engage and challenge true star wars fans. It has been designed so that it is easy to follow, offers different path ways to the user, flows easily from one section to the next and is fully responsive to the users chosen device.</p>
<br>
<p>The use of interactive buttons and sound effects have been implemented to stimulate the users senses and aid in the users immersion as they play the game.</p>
<br>
<p>I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Framework, jQuery and JavaScript for this project, which will form part of my ongoing portfolio of work.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-ux" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ux"></a><strong>UX</strong></h2>
<h3><a id="user-content-user-stories" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#user-stories"></a>User stories</h3>
<p>As a user:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I want the landing page to engage me instantly, as this will encourage me to go on further and actually play the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manouvering around the site needs to be made clear and instructive wihtout any confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quiz needs to be accessible and straightforward, with instructions and a mute button if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to make the game personal to myself, so it gives me a unique experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to share my score with my friends, and compare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to stay updated with my correct and wrong answers during the quiz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be able to see how long I have to answer each question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want the questions to be randomised so they are not the same as previous games.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-design-choices" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-choices"></a>Design Choices</h2>
<h3><a id="user-content-colours" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#colours"></a>Colours</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Template and Modal</strong> - I decided to use <code>#FEDA4A</code>(Yellow) as this is the actual star wars logo colour and it also helped the content stand out against the various buttons, backgrounds and images used throughout the site. The colour had an warm feel to me and gave me sense of Star Wars resemblence and nostalgia, which is the main aim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buttons and Icons</strong> - I decided to use red and blue which bares resemblence to the colours of the lightsabers in Star Wars(Light and Dark). This further adds to the Star Wars theme aswell as standing out against other images and colours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Font Colour</strong> - I decided to use <code>#FEDA4A</code>(Yellow) &amp; <code>#000000</code>(Black) for the text as it keeps with the theme, plus I also like when text feels like a hole through it's canvas it sits on, which this achieves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="user-content-fonts" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fonts"></a>Fonts</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comfortaa:wght@700&family=Staatliches&display=swap" rel="nofollow"><strong>Staatliches</strong></a> - I used this font for everything. I felt that it had a space, computer vibe to it, plus it was very bold to help stand out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="<https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Pathway+Gothic+One&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pathway Gothic One</strong></a> - I used this font for quiz questions and answers on smaller screens as I found it was easier to read.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="user-content-wireframes" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#wireframes"></a>Wireframes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The wireframes for the initial layout of the website were created using <a href="https://whimsical.com/" rel="nofollow">whimsical</a> and you can view the wireframes for Star Wars Quiz <a href="https://github.com/Andy-Osborne/Dwarf-Match/tree/master/wireframes">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wireframes include a design layout for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The colour scheme I had in mind when designing the mockups was not available on the site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="user-content-variation-between-wireframes-and-final-product" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#variation-between-wireframes-and-final-product"></a>Variation Between Wireframes and Final Product</h4>
<p>During the styling phase of the website I stuck to the original wireframe design, only adding slighty more detail and content like:</p>
<h5><a id="user-content-landing-page" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#landing-page"></a>Landing Page</h5>
<ul>
<li>The entrance scrolling credits and the moving star background on the.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="user-content-level-select-modal" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#level-select-modal"></a>Modal</h4>
<ul>
<li>I did not include the design for my modal, as that was added at a later date.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="user-content-audio-control-modal" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#audio-control-modal"></a>Social sharing icons</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I did not include the social sharing icons as I thought later on that people would like to share their score with others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="user-content-technologies-used" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#technologies-used"></a>Technologies Used</h2>

</ol>
<h2><a id="user-content-features" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features"></a>Features</h2>
<h3><a id="user-content-existing-features" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#existing-features"></a>Existing Features</h3>
<p>Intro Page</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The introduction page features a brief introduction to the game which is animated to look like the opening sequence of Star Wars movies.</p>
</li>
<p>Landing Page</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The landing page features an animated background of moving stars to give the notion that the heading is flying, the heading itself is designed to look like the star wars logo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also a two button option of which side the user wants to take(light or dark) and on full monitors, when hovering over the button, a blue lightsaber appears out of the lightside button and red out of the other, with lightsaber audio also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also I have included a sound icon so the user can easily switch the sound on and off.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Start Menu</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The start menu is made up of three large buttons, which can either take you back to the landing page, start the quiz, or bring up the instructions, these buttons also produce sounds on click.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instruction Modal</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the instructions button is clicked a bordered pop up window appears displaying the instructions to the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user can easily close this window via the cross icon, which also makes a sound on close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quiz Area</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The quiz area is made up of a grid containing an image, question and four possible answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This grid is flexible and adjusts for different screen sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Below the grid is a series of icons which represent each question, turning blue for a correct answer and red for a wrong answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user is also notified of right and wrong answers by the sound the game makes after they have selected their answer, which can be muted in the bottom left corner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Counter and Timer</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a user starts the quiz, there is an active timer that starts the moment the site renders the question, counting down from twenty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the timer runs out, the answer will be marked wrong and will automatically progress to the next question, and the timer restarts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="user-content-features-to-be-implemented" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#features-to-be-implemented"></a>Features To Be Implemented</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I want to implement a leaderboard so users of the game can match up their scores against fellow players.</p>

<p>I want to implement a level system, where the questions get harder each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to implement a restart button so the user doesn't have to go back to the home page every time they want to retry.</p>
</li>

<h2><a id="user-content-deployment" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#deployment"></a>Deployment</h2>
<p>I developed this project using <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/" rel="nofollow">Gitpod</a>. Version control was done using git and hosting the repository was done through GitHub.</p>
<p>The live site was deployed via GitHub Pages and is and stems directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the opening page must be named <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>To deploy Star Wars Quiz from its <a href="https://github.com/Andy-Osborne/Dwarf-Match">repository in GitHub</a>, I completed the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into GitHub</li>
<li>From the list of repositories, select <a href="https://github.com/lewejuice/starwars-quiz"><strong>lewejuice/starwars-quiz</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Click on the settings button located just below the Fork option.</li>
<li>Scroll down the new page to GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>Select Master Branch from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>After selecting Master Branch, the page will refresh and <a href="https://github.com/lewejuice/starwars-quiz/"><strong>Star Wars Quiz</strong></a> is deployed.</li>
<li>If you scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section after the page refreshes, you can grab your live link to your deployed site.</li>
</ol>
